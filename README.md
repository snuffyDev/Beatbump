## Why Beatbump?

Beatbump is a fully-featured music listening experience, while helping to ease your privacy concerns associated with other platforms.

Some of Beatbump's features includes:

- Automix for continued listening
- No ads
- Background play on mobile devices\*
- Search for artists, playlists, songs, and albums
  - Note that all playback is audio only (for now)
- Local playlist management
  - Stored in-browser with IndexedDB
  - Can save songs individually under 'Favorites'
  - Peer-to-Peer data synchronization (using WebRTC)
- Group Sessions
  - Achieved using a WebRTC [mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking)
- Uses a custom wrapper around the YouTube Music API

...and so much more!

## Docker

> Note: Still figuring out how to use Docker! Got a suggestion? Open an issue, thanks!

[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/snuffydev/beatbump)

### docker-compose (production)
The quickest way to host a Beatbump instance is with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Once you have it installed, you can run:

```
docker-compose up
```

The app will now be accessible from `https://localhost:443  /  http://localhost:3000`.

### docker-compose (development)


(More details coming soon!)

## Documentation

You can find (temporary, incomplete, and in-progress) API documentation here: https://beatbump-docs.vercel.app/

> It's recommended (and appreciated) to host your own instance of Beatbump for public projects that want to use the data -- especially if you anticipate you will be making a large amount of requests. Thanks!
